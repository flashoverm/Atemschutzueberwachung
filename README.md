# Atemschutzueberwachung


Improvements:

- If Text is to long for TextView -> Animate horizontal translation

- If operation is active, background light doesnt turn off

- Draegerman collection with editable (TextEdit to enter foreign names) and Spinner right of it, to choose from list. Chosen draegerman is entered in the text edit

- Configuration of reminder and alarm in administration menu: Vibration yes/no, flashlight yes/no, sound yes/no



Future Updates:

- V1.3  Enter situation reports (Dt. Lagemeldungen) from squad with textEdit or from list? (+ timestamp, operation time).
  I.e. "Feuer aus", "Person gefunden", "Person an RD Ã¼bergeben" ...

- V1.4  Live-backup on SD-Card (if there) to avoid data loss on hardware failure
